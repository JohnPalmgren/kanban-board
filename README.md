## Overview

A react project using `react-beautiful-dnd` to achieve a drag and drop effect. I wanted to build somthing a bit more interesting and complex than a simple to-do list. The `react-beautiful-dnd` package didn't work strait away but there is some good documentation online and I googled my way through it.

- Move tasks between columns
